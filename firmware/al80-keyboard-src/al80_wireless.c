 * BLE / 2.4G support for the AL80's SmartBLE coprocessor.
 *
 * The radio is a separate UART coprocessor (BLE adv name "YUNZII AL80 BT"),
 * NOT part of the STM32. It hangs off USART1 (PA9 TX / PA10 RX, 460800 8N1)
 * and speaks a short `0x55 <len> <payload>` framing. Going wireless means
 * (a) telling the module which mode to enter and (b) swapping QMK's host
 * driver so HID reports are written to the module instead of USB.
 *
 * Written against the protocol as documented in AL80_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md SD5 and
 * research/al80-wireless-port-SPARC.md, not copied from the b75Pro vendor
 * source -- that source is Apache-2.0 and this tree is GPL-2.0, which are not
 * compatible for redistribution.
 *
 * Deliberate design notes:
 *
 *  - Mode switches block for ~400ms (60 wake bytes + a 350ms settle the module
 *    needs to come out of sleep). That must never happen inside the key path;
 *    it is the same class of stall as the v24 typing regression. A keypress
 *    only sets g_wireless_request, and al80_wireless_task() -- driven from
 *    housekeeping_task_kb -- does the blocking work.
 *
 *  - USART3 (LCD) is interrupt-driven and already sensitive to preemption; that
 *    is what g_screen_busy exists for. USART1 traffic is a second source of the
 *    same pressure, so mode switches defer while the screen is busy.
 *
 *  - In USB mode this file costs nothing at runtime: the host driver is
 *    untouched and the task early-returns.
